# CSC455 Final Project - Bank Database
A mock banking database with a web front end written in python.

#### Notes to group.

If you are connecting to mySQL normally through satoshi you can run `use narayanFall2020group3;` and the database should currently be operating as intended.

If it is not you can clone this repo to your satoshi directory, then run `source bank.sql` followed by `source insertData.sql` to rebuild the database.
